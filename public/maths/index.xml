Fundamental Theorem Of Arithmetic The fundamental theorem of arithmetic (FTA), also called the unique factorization theorem, states that every integer greater than 1 either is prime itself or is the product of a unique combination of prime numbers.
1 is not considered prime because we lose uniqueness in factorization if we consider it a prime:
25 = 5 * 5 * 1= 5 * 5 * 1 * 1= 5 * 5 * 1 * 1 * 1.</description>

      <description>GCD GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) or HCF (Highest Common Factor) of n numbers n1, n2, n3, &amp;hellip; is defined as largest number g which divides all of them. Ex - GCD(15, 20) = 5, GCD(6,7) = 1.
Properties   GCD(a, b) &amp;lt;= min(a, b)
  GCD(a, b) &amp;gt;= 1
  GCD(a, b) = GCD(|a|, |b|)
  For any non-zero m ∈ Z, GCD(ma, mb) = |m| * GCD(a, b)</description>

      <description>Properties, Conjectures and Theorems Definition: A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has exactly two positive integer divisors, 1 and itself.
1 is neither a prime, nor a composite. 2 is the only even prime. Only consecutive primes are 2 and 3. Every prime number can represented in form of 6n±1 except 2 and 3, where n is natural number. There are infinitely many primes. Prime Number Theorem - The number of primes till n are approximately equal to n /ln (n) when n is large.</description>

      <title>Prime Factorization and Divisors</title>

      <description>Recall: Fundamental Theorem Of Arithmetic
Important Points  The number of divisors is odd only for perfect square numbers. For the rest, the count is even. Use floor(sqrt(b)) - ceil(sqrt(a)) + 1 to calculate all perfect square numbers between a and b. Only a prime&amp;rsquo;s square has exactly 3 distinct factors i.e. 1, p, and p2. Power of a prime p in n! is given by Legendre&amp;rsquo;s Factorization of n! =&amp;gt; Power of p in n!</description>

      <description>In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, F0= 0, F1= 1, and Fn= Fn-1+ Fn-2 for n &amp;gt; 1. Sequence = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, &amp;hellip;
Negative : The Fibonacci sequence also works below 0.</description>

      <description>Divisibility Rules  2n, 5n, and 10n- Check if the last n digits are divisible. 3 and 9 - Check if digital sum is divisible. 6 - Check if number is divisible by both 2 and 3. 7 - Subtract twice the last digit from the remaining number and check divisibility again. Another method is triplet method (make triplets from right and do alternate +/- and check the result for divisibility by 7 again&amp;hellip; this is useful for very large numbers).</description>

      <description>Remainders and % Operator In Maths:
15 mod 7 = 112 mod 5 = 216 mod 4 = 02 mod 6 = 2-1 mod 5 = -1 =&amp;gt; 4	//do 1 mod 5 and add negative sign-15 mod 7 = -1 =&amp;gt; 6-12 mod 5 = -2 =&amp;gt; 312 mod -5 = 2 =&amp;gt; -316 mod -4 = 0In Programming:
 If x completely divides y, the result of the expression y % x is 0.</description>
