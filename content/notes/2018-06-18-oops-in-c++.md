## Goals
Everything in the real-world has a name and a functionality associated with it.
Ex - A name of an object is "Dog", it can have various parameters like breed, length, height, or the functions it can perform like running, eating, sleeping.

What we can do is that we can create objects of a Dog and then whenever we want to store different information about any Dog, we can use that object again and again.

Everything that has an independent existence in real-life is called an **Object**, it can also be called as an **Instance** of a class.

A **Class** is the blueprint for an object that tells the compiler how and what our object and its properties and functions are.

```
// Define Blueprint

class Car
{
	public:
		int price;
		int model_no;				// Data Member

		bool isRunning();		// Function
};

int main()
{
	Car c;	// To create object just like we declare a variable of a type
	cout << sizeof(c); 	// c is an object of 8 bytes
	cout << sizeof(Car); 	// 8 bytes because sizeof() returns size of the object when it'll be created
	// A class is just a piece of code and is nothing without its object

	Car R[100];  // Array of Cars
}
```

The properties (variables) like name and size are called as **Data Members**.
```
int num;
char name[20];
```
The functions and tasks associated are called **Functions**.
```
int nRotations();
bool isRunning();
```
### Dot(.) Operator

Used to access Data Members and Functions.
```
Car c;
c.name = "BMW";
c.model_no = 1991;
c.isRunning();
```
### Access Modifiers

1. **private** - By Default C++ has all data members and functions as Private.
They cannot be accessed by functions not part of the class.
2. **public** - They can be accessed anywhere.
```
class Pen
{
	public:
	string name;
	string colour;
}
```
3. **protected**


### Getters and Setters

**Getters** are used to get the value of a data member.

**Setters** are used to set the value of a data member.
```
class Car
{
    string name;  
};

int main()
{
    Car c;
    c.name="Audi"; 	// directly accessing a private data member not allowed
}

```
We can use getters and setters to access and modify private data members as shown below.
```
class Car
{
    private:
    int year;

    public:
    void setYear(int y)		// Setter Function
    {
        year=y;
    }

    int getYear()				// Getter Function
    {
        return year;
    }

};

int main()
{
    Car c;
    c.setYear(2006);			// Setter Function Call
    cout << c.getYear();	// Getter Function Call
}

```
### Memory allocation
Every Object and Data Member gets allocated a space, but Functions have a **common memory across all objects**.
