## Memory Management

### Memory Layout
![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/memoryLayoutC.jpg)

```txt
stack: funtion call stack, local variables

heap: dynamically allocated data objects

initialized data: global or static variables (initialized)
uninitialized data: global or static variables (uninitialized) a.k.a BSS (block started by symbol)

text: stores source code
```
```c
// use size command to get memory layout
> size test.exe
```
### Dynamic Allocation Fucntions
[Reference](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c-using-malloc-calloc-free-and-realloc/)

- `<stdlib.h>` functions: returns pointer to allocated block or `NULL`.

1. **malloc():** memory allocation, fills with garbage
```c
Syntax: void* malloc(size_t size)

Usage: int* p = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
```

2. **calloc():** continuous allocation of _n_ objects, each has `0`
```c
Syntax: void* calloc(n, size_t size)

Usage:int* p = (int*) calloc (5, sizeof(int))
```

3. **realloc():** Reallocates memory block of a previously allocated block
```c
Syntax: void* realloc(void* p, size_t size)

Usage:int* pNew = (int*) realloc (p, 10 * sizeof(int)) 		// more memory was allocated, may not start from the same location
```

4. **free():** frees memory. Takes only one argument (pointer) since above functions implicitly store size information that `free()` can read.
```c
free(p);
```
Avoids memory leaks.

#### Tips
- `calloc()` is just `malloc()` followed by `memset()` to `0`
- we can free allocated memory by `free()` or by `realloc(0, size)`
- the above two are equivalent in outcome but not at all interchangeable because of optimization and surprises.

- Other functions

1. **memset():** originally made for setting characters but can be used to set memory to **only 0**.
```c
Syntax: void memset(void* ptr, int c, size_t size)

Usage: memset(arr, 0, sizeof arr);
```

## File Management

### Operations
```c
To open a file: fopen(const char* filename, const char* mode)
To read a file: fscanf() or fgets()
To write to a file: fputs() or fprintf()
To close a file: fclose(FILE* fp)
```
