- Arrays are always passed by reference, be it character array(string) in C++.

## cin
- cin ifnores whitespaces and reads only non-whitespace characters, cin reads from a file known as 'stdin'"istream" and cin can be _invalidated_ by supplying value of a type that is not expected, cin gets invalidated and never takes any input throughout the rest of the program.

```
return cin; 	//will return false if cin has been invalidated before
```
 We can _re-validate_ ` cin by cin.clear(); `.
 
- Enter or '\n' is a valid character and is written into and read from the istream file just as other characters, but it is also a delimiter for cin and cin.getline().

## cin.get() 

- it taks only one input at a time and that **_includes_** whitespaces.

## cin.getline()

```
char str[100];
cin.getline(str,90,'$')  //cin.getline(storage_string_name, max_size, 'delimiter_character')	[max_size<str_size]
```
- Delimiter is not read by cin.getline().
- By default delimiter is '\n' aka newline character/Enter.
 
```
cin.getline(str,90); // default delimiter`
```	

- cin.getline() will not ignore whitespaces and wil go onto read until delimiter, charaters from the file after the delimiter will not be read.
