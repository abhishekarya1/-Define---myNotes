### Constant Data Members
Data Members declared with **cont** keyword cannot be re-initialised.
They **must** be initialized once.
They can be declared once and initialised once.
```
const int x;      // Declaration

x = 90;           // Initialisation
```
### Initialisation List
Any const data member must be initialised in Initialisation List.
```
Car():name(NULL), year(1991)
{

}

Car(int price, int m):price(p), model(m)      // Memory allocated to variables before entering the body of the constructor
{

}
```
### Constant Functions
Those functions that do not update data members of a class. They are basically there to identify themselves that they do not update any data members, so no need to debug them for data member related bugs.
```
void start() const
{
  // Body
}
```
### Constant Parameter
To declare a parameter as a constant for a function, they remain constant for that function throughout its scope.
```
void print(const int n, char name)
{
  // Body
}
// n cannot be changed throughout the scope of the print() function.
```
